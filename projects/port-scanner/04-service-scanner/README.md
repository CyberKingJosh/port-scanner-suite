# 04 â€” Service Scanner

## ðŸ“Œ What it does
Scans a **target IP address** over a range of ports and also **identifies the service running** on each open port using `socket.getservbyport()`.

This adds a practical layer to a port scan â€” knowing which service is running helps prioritise security checks.
